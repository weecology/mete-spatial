===========

Code for working with the spatial predictions of John Harte and colleagues' Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology.

The code in this project is for two projects, one that investigates the species-area relationship (SAR) and another that investigates the distance decay relationship
(DDR). 

Species-area Project
--------------------

The SAR code provides the supplemental material to: 

McGlinn, D.J., X. Xiao, E.P. White. 2013. An empirical evaluation of four
variants of a universal species-area relationship. PeerJ. 1: e212. (http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.212)


### Setup

Requirements: R ≥ 2.7.0 with the R package `RCurl` installed. Python 2.x and the following Python modules: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `mpmath`. You will also need two of our custom Python modules: `mete` (https://github.com/weecology/METE) and `macroecotools` (https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools).
These modules can be installed by running the following commands from the command
line (with sufficient permissions):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weecology/METE.git
cd METE
python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools.git
cd macroecotools
python setup.py install
```

### Replicate analyses

The analyses can be replicated by running the following commands from the
command line.

Run all analyses and generate figures:
`Rscript sar_run_all.R`

Please note that these analyses involve both a large amount of data and a lot of
computational work and therefore take a while to run. Expect the empirical
analysis to take a few hours. 

Distance-decay Project
----------------------

The DDR code provides the supplemental material to:  

McGlinn, D.J., X. Xiao, J. Kitizes E.P. White. 2015. Exploring the spatially explicit predictions of the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology. 24:675-684. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12295

### Setup

Requirements: 4 GB of RAM, 64-bit R ≥ 2.7.0 with the R packages `vegan`, `RCurl`, `hash`, and `bigmemory `installed. Python 2.x and the following Python modules: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `mpmath`. You will also need two of our custom Python modules: `mete` (https://github.com/weecology/METE) and `macroecotools` (https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools).
These modules can be installed by running the following commands from the command
line (with sufficient permissions)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weecology/METE.git
cd METE
python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools.git
cd macroecotools
python setup.py install
```

### Replicate analyses

The analyses can be replicated by running the following commands from the
command line.

Run all analyses and generate figures:
`Rscript ddr_run_all.R`

Please note that these analyses involve both a large amount of data and a lot of
computational work and therefore take a while to run. Expect the empirical
analysis to take a few hours.
